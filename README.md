## Laboratory 9 Assignment

### Assigned: November 7, 2022

### Due: November 16, 2022 (before 2:00 pm)

---

## Learning Goals

1.  Utilize a numerical integration method to solve an engineering problem.
2.  Continue practicing writing user defined functions, and
2.  Produce an estimate within $\pm 1\%$ of the true value to receive full credit.

## Problem Description

Solve the following problem:

$$
\int_0^3x^2e^x\,dx
$$


## Your Solution

### Cell 1

Update your personal information found in the first cell that is a Markdown cell.

### Cell 2

In cell 2 (Markdown cell), describe the root finding technique that you will use and the reason you selected your root finding technique. 

### Cell 3

In cell 3 (code cell), enter the Python code to implement your root finding solution. Your solution must include a user-defined function that returns $f(x)=x^2e^x$.
